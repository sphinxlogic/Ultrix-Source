<p>
Ultrix (officially all-caps ULTRIX) was the brand name of Digital Equipment
Corporation's (DEC) native Unix systems. While ultrix is the Latin word for
avenger, the name was chosen solely for its sound.
<p>
There were two variants of Ultrix: Ultrix-11 which ran on the PDP-11 family,
and Ultrix-32 which ran on the VAX platform. This version is Ultrix-11.
